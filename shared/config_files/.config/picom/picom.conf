# Specify a list of opacity rules, in the format `PERCENT:PATTERN`, 
# like `50:name *= "Firefox"`. picom-trans is recommended over this. 
# Note we don't make any guarantee about possible conflicts with other 
# programs that set '_NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY' on frame or client windows.
# example:
#    opacity-rule = [ "80:class_g = 'URxvt'" ];
#
opacity-rule = [
	"80:class_g = 'URxvt' && focused",
	"60:class_g = 'URxvt' && !focused"
]
